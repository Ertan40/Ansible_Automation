# Ansible

Ansible is an open source, command-line IT automation software application written in Python. It can configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate advanced workflows to support application deployment, cloud provisioning, ad-hoc task execution, network automation, and multi-node orchestration. Ansible makes complex changes like zero-downtime rolling updates with load balancers easy. More information on the Ansible - website: https://www.ansible.com/

## What's Inside?

In this repo, you'll find a Docker Compose file along with DockerFiles that sets up a playground for your Ansible which you can exercise. In addition to that included my demos.
